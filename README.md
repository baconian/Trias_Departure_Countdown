# Trias_Departure_Countdown

This programm uses the Trias-API to request the departure times for a specific stop and creates a countdown for upcoming departures.
This should work with all public transport services that provide data in accordance with: [VDV 431-2](https://www.vdv.de/431-2-sdsv1.2.pdfx?forced=true).

## Documentation

The program will prompt you to provide a trias link. This is a link provided by your public transport service, to which you can send http-requests.
The RequestorRef identifies you to the server.
For the stop simply enter the name of a station you want to create a countdown for.
The program is written in python. Comments can be found in the code.
